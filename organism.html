      <h3> Level 1 Cells </h3>
      <p> The first level to form a organism is the cell. Cells are the smallest unit of life. There are two kind of oragnisms. One kind is the unicellular and the other is the multicelluar. 
      Unicellular are organisms that are made of one cell. If that cell cell was destroyed, the whole system dies. If the whole system dies, the organism dies too. 
      Multicellular are organisms that are made of more than one cell. If one cell died the other cell will function adn make more cells, so that the organism won't die. </p>
